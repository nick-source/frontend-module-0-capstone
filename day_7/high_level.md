### The Caeser Cipher
So the goal is to create a function that takes a string input and an integer for how many letters to offset each letter in the string, and then outputs a new "ciphered" string.  
I would need to start by assigning each letter in the alphabet a number value, so I would create an "alphabet" object doing exactly that, with the letters as the keys and the numbers as the values.  
Then, I would declare the function and the arguments it takes, one being the string and the next being the number to offset each letter by.
